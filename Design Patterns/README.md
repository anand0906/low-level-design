<h1>Design Petterns</h1>
<p>Design patterns are standard solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.</p>
<p>They’re like templates or blueprints that can be applied to solve specific issues when designing software systems</p>
<p>Rather than solving problems from scratch, developers can use these patterns to achieve a flexible, reusable, and maintainable code structure.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A design pattern is like a general idea for solving a problem in programming. It's not just a piece of code you can copy; it's a concept that you can adapt to fit your specific situation.</li>
	<li>People often mix up patterns with algorithms. An algorithm is a specific set of steps to achieve a goal, like a cooking recipe. In contrast, a pattern is more like a blueprint for building something. It shows you what the end result should look like but leaves the details of how to get there up to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, while an algorithm tells you exactly what to do, a pattern gives you a guide that you can modify for your own needs.</p>
<p>Design patterns can be classified into three main categories based on their purpose and use. Here’s a simple breakdown:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Creational Patterns</strong> :  Deals with how objects are created.</li>
	<li><strong>Structural Patterns</strong> :  Deals with assembling objects and classes into larger structures.</li>
	<li><strong>Behavioral Patterns</strong> :  Deals with how objects interact and communicate with each other.</li>
</ul>
